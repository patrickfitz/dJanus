Django wrapper for the Janus WebRTC Gateway

Over at https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway they've created an excellent WebRTC gateway. This project is designed to extend this gateway by adding a django wrapper enabling, in the first instance, ldap authentication.

By making a django app it should be easy to embed Janus features such as clientless video conferencing into your web applications.
